Yes, the data looks like a curve

Note the range of C values used in Figure 4 is the same in Figure 2 but only a select set of values were shown.
Figure 4 shows a table of the weights associated with each engineered feature and its corresponding hyperparamter C. Just like in Figure 2, x_2 and x_1 has the largest influence over the output because they are the only weights that are greater than one.

epeat (b)-(c) for a Ridge Regression model. This uses an L2 penalty instead of
an L1 penalty in the cost function. Compare the impact on the model parameters
of changing C with Lasso Regression and with Ridge Regression.

With reference to this plot discuss how the predictions change as C is varied.
